# Part 1 - Recommendation System Explanation
A. Content filtering: Use the attributes or features of an item to recommend. 
B. Collaborative filtering: Recommend items based on preference information from many users, it will measure how similar the attributes are to each other in order to predict preference and provide recommendation.

 B-1. Memory-Based: 
 Uses historical records to calculate recommended products using mathematical statistics. There are 2 types of Memory-based, one is user based - users similar to you also purchased, and the other is item based - people who bought this product also bought.

 B-2. Model-Based:
 KNN regression and Matrix Factorization.

# Part 2 - Deep learning based recommender systems
A joint research analyzed by people from Duke University and Meta, has developed a new model to tackle with the common challenges of adopting AutoML in recommendation system.
